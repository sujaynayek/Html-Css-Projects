He was a senior leader of the Indian National Congress, who played a significant role in the country's struggle for independence and its political integration.[1] In India and elsewhere, he was often called Sardar, meaning "Chief" in Hindi, Urdu, Bengali and Persian. He acted as the Home Minister during the political integration of India and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.[2]
